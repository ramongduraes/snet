# Publishing Services

SingularityNET is an open-source protocol and collection of smart contracts for a decentralized market of coordinated AI services. Within this framework, anyone can add an AI/machine learning service to SingularityNET for use by the network, and receive network payment tokens in exchange.

As an AI/machine learning service developer, you can expose your service to the SingularityNET by running an instance of SNET Daemon alongside it. The Daemon interacts with the blockchain to facilitate authorization and payment for services and acts as a pass-through for making API calls to the service.  There are currently 3 ways by which the Daemon can communicate with a service:

> Here maybe we could link to the tutorials using cards

- [As an executable/process through stdin and stdout](TODO)
- [Using JSON-RPC](TODO)
- [Using gRPC](TODO)

Here are a few programming language-specific tutorials you can follow to publish a service onto SNET:

- [C++](TODO)
- [Go](TODO)
- [Java](TODO)
- [Python](TODO)


- [OpenCog](TODO): add link to exaplain opencog as well

## Updating published service

update service metadata 

update service model

## Claiming funds

explain etcd (distributed DB that keeps the signatures of all the service's transactions) and its mapping. 
*Emphasize how important this is since the service provider could lose all the tokens/users could make infinite calls it .etcd files are lost.*
