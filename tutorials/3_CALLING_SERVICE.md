# Calling a Service Through SNET CLI

> This tutorial assumes you have successfully [installed](TODO) and [set up](TODO) SNET CLI.

Calling an AI service will mostly be done through our soon to be released [SNET DApp](TODO): a marketplace for exploring available AI services and interacting with them through a web-UI. However, if you're an AI developer interested in publishing a service, you should probably know how to call it through SNET's Command Line Interface so that you can test your service back-end independently. It is also useful in case you plan on creating a service that interacts with other services.

TODO: MPE here

## Finding Information about Organizations and Services

Having installed SNET CLI and set up a session, you may now access the list of organization IDs in SNET's Registry by running `snet organization list`. Once you find an organization of interest, you may view further information about it through `snet organization info ORG_ID`, including its name, the public keys of its owner and members and a list of all its services. If you're only interested in the list of services, you can view that using `snet organization list-services ORG_ID`.

Once you have decided on the organization and service of interest, another useful command is `snet service print-metadata ORG_ID SERVICE_ID`. That will print to terminal some off-chain information related to the service. For this tutorial, the most relevant information is the service's endpoint.

## 

2) SNET CLI Organizations, list, etc

Say that this will mostly be done through SNET DApp (or at least be way easier to accomplish there).

- get service metadata to know what it expects
- snet client call

3) MPE, channels, open and iniialize one

USE +30days +NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS instead of just checking current block and adding an arbitrary number.

# DRAFT

MPE : A smart contract that facilitates transactions between users and AI service developers. It provides a wallet functionality (deposit and withdraw funds) as well as uni-directional payment channels between users and AI service developers enabling users to pay for service invocations
